Sound Camera

Project created in KiCad.

An array of digital MEMS microphones connected to a single clock source. 

It contains the following:

 1. A 2 row, 40-pin 100mil spacing connection header.
 2. A major array that consists of 16 microphones spaced equally across the PCB.
 2. Two minor arrays of 9 microphones that make up the 'lower left' and 'upper right' quadrants of the major array.
 3. A temperature and pressure sensor with clock selection jumper resistors.
 4. An ultra-sonic speaker and amp.
 5. An option header to allow multiple arrays to be ganged together on the same ribbon cable.
